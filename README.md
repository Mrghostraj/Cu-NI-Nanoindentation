Spherical Nanoindentation Simulation: Substrate Size, Indenter Radius, and Force Constant Effects
Overview

This project investigates the critical parameters influencing spherical nanoindentation simulations using Molecular Dynamics (MD). The study focuses on a Nickel (Ni) substrate with a Copper (Cu) base and aims to quantify the effect of:

Substrate size

Indenter radius

Force constant (k)

on the material's mechanical response, specifically:

Force vs. Depth curve

Hardness (H)

Young's Modulus (E)

The simulations were performed using the LAMMPS MD package with the EAM/alloy potential to model interatomic forces.

Simulation Details
System Setup
Parameter	Value / Material	Description
Substrate	Nickel (Ni)	Primary material being indented
Base	Copper (Cu, 1 unit thick)	Rigid, stationary base layer (set force = 0)
Potential	EAM/alloy	Models pairwise interactions between metals and metal alloys
Indenter Type	Ghost Spherical Indenter	Indents along the y-direction, centered on the substrate
Indentation Depth	Constant (~28 units)	Maintained across all cases for comparison
Velocity	Constant	Ensures consistent indentation rate
Key Simulation Parameters Investigated
1. Effect of Substrate Size

Objective: Investigate how varying substrate dimensions affects mechanical properties with a fixed indenter radius of 15 units.

Case	Substrate Dimensions (units)	Key Observation
1	Smallest	Highest Hardness. Rigid boundaries restrict atom/dislocation motion → Boundary effect. High load drop on unloading.
2	Medium	Hardness and Young's Modulus decrease. Reduced boundary effect allows more atomic relaxation.
3	Large	Further decrease in Young's Modulus. Force vs. Depth curve shows rapid fluctuations.
4	Largest	Lowest Hardness and Young's Modulus. Smooth curve indicates minimal boundary interference and efficient atomic relaxation.

Summary: Increasing substrate size reduces Hardness and Young's Modulus due to enhanced atomic/dislocation relaxation and reduced boundary effects, approaching bulk behavior.

2. Effect of Indenter Radius

Objective: Analyze the effect of indenter radius with a fixed large substrate.

Indenter Radius (r)	Observations
Increasing r	Maximum load increases due to larger contact area; deformation becomes tougher.
	Unloading slope becomes steeper → Young's Modulus increases.

Summary: Larger indenter radii increase Maximum Load, Hardness, and Young's Modulus because a larger area requires greater force to initiate plastic deformation.

3. Effect of Force Constant (k)

Objective: Study how indenter stiffness affects the indentation response.

Case	Substrate Size	Indenter Radius	Force Constant (k)	Observation
1	Small	15 units	High k (100, 10, 1)	Steep curves, higher forces
1	Small	15 units	Low k (0.1, 0.01)	Shallow, smooth curves
2	Large	30 units	High k	Higher force, less noise than small domain
2	Large	30 units	Low k	Lower force, smoother response

Conclusion: The force constant profoundly influences the load-depth response. High k → higher forces, potential numerical artifacts. Low k → underestimation of mechanical properties. Appropriate selection of k is essential for realistic results.

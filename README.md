Spherical Nanoindentation Simulation: Substrate Size, Indenter Radius, and Force Constant EffectsOverviewThis project investigates the critical parameters influencing spherical nanoindentation simulations using Molecular Dynamics (MD), focusing on a Nickel (Ni) substrate with a Copper (Cu) base. The primary goal is to quantify and understand the effect of substrate size, indenter radius, and force constant () on the material's mechanical response, specifically the Force vs. Depth curve, Hardness (), and Young's Modulus ().The simulations use the LAMMPS MD package with an EAM/alloy potential (Embedded-Atom Method) to model the interatomic forces.Simulation DetailsSystem SetupParameterValue / MaterialDescriptionSubstrateNickel (Ni)Primary material being indented.BaseCopper (Cu, 1 unit thick)Rigid, stationary base layer (setforce zero).PotentialEAM/alloyUsed for pairwise interaction between metals and metal alloys.Indenter TypeGhost Indenter (Spherical)Indents along the y-direction, centered on the substrate.Indentation DepthConstant (approx. 28 units)Applied in all comparative cases.VelocityConstantMaintained across all cases for consistent comparison.Key Simulation Parameters InvestigatedThe study is divided into three main investigations:1. Effect of Substrate SizeThis section explores how varying the substrate dimensions impacts the mechanical properties, keeping the indenter radius constant at 15 units.CaseSubstrate Dimensions (units)Key FindingCase 1Highest Hardness (). Rigid boundaries restrict atom/dislocation motion, leading to the Boundary Effect. High load drop on unloading.Case 2Hardness and Young's Modulus decrease compared to Case 1. Boundary effect is reduced, allowing atoms more space to relax.Case 3Further decrease in Young's Modulus. Curve shows rapid fluctuation.Case 4Lowest Hardness and Young's Modulus. Best reduction of the sudden load drop, indicating efficient atomic relaxation and minimal boundary interference.Summary: Increasing the substrate size decreases Hardness and Young's Modulus, as the increased space allows for freer atomic and dislocation movement, reducing the influence of rigid boundaries and promoting behavior closer to bulk material.2. Effect of Indenter RadiusThis section examines the influence of indenter radius on a fixed large substrate size of  units.Indenter Radius (r)Observation on Force vs. DepthExplanation to Maximum load increases substantially as radius increases.Larger contact area requires a larger force for indentation. Forces are less concentrated, making deformation tougher.Unloading SlopeSlope becomes steeper upward with increasing radius.The increasing slope corresponds to an increase in Young's Modulus.Summary: Increasing the indenter radius increases the maximum load, Hardness, and Young's Modulus due to the larger interaction area requiring greater force to initiate plastic deformation.3. Effect of Force Constant ()The force constant () determines the indenter's "stiffness." This was tested across two configurations:ConfigurationDimensionsIndenter RadiusForce Constant (k) EffectCase 115 unitsHigh  (100, 10, 1) results in steep curves and higher forces. Low  (0.1, 0.01) results in shallower, smoother curves.Case 230 unitsConsistent trend: higher  yields higher force. Less noise than Case 1, confirming that larger domains offer more stable and realistic behavior.Conclusion: The force constant profoundly influences the load-depth response. Selecting an appropriate  value is essential to accurately match experimental stiffness. Low  values can underestimate mechanical properties, while high  values can introduce numerical artifacts.Calculations UsedHardness ()Where: = Load applied = Diameter of the indenter = Maximum depth of indentationYoung's Modulus ()The Young's Modulus is determined by finding the slope of the unloading curve in the Force vs. Depth plot.Unit ConventionThe simulation uses Metal Units as defined by the LAMMPS documentation:QuantityMetal Units (LAMMPS)SI Units (Approximate Conversion)LengthÅ (angstrom)1 A˚=1×10−10 mMassamu (atomic mass unit)1 amu≈1.66×10−27 kgEnergyeV (electronvolt)1 eV≈1.60×10−19 JForce1 eV/A˚≈1.60×10−9 NReferencesFor detailed formulas, methods, and discussion:LAMMPS Documentation: Units Section.Hardness Formula: Equation 9.1, Brinell Hardness Test (BHN), Mechanical Metallurgy by George E.
